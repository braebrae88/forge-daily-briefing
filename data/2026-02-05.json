    "summary": "OCR-powered vet bill analyzer. Upload receipt, system extracts line items, matches against regional pricing database, returns verdict: 'Within range' or 'Flag this.' Free tier scans one bill, $5/mo for unlimited. Pet insurance companies license API to pre-screen claims. 67% of US households own pets, $35B annual vet spend.",

    "revenueEstimate": "$100K-$1M ARR",
    "healthcareAngle": "Not clinical healthcare, but pattern is instructive: OCR extraction → benchmark comparison → transparency verdict → defensible record. That's the same stack as LUMEN SDK, just applied to consumer vet billing instead of clinical AI decisions. The market signal: consumers want AI-powered transparency when stakes are high and pricing is opaque. If pet owners demand this for $400 dental cleanings, imagine the demand from hospital boards for $10M clinical AI deployments. Validates the 'governance at runtime' thesis across sectors.",
    "verdict": "skip",
    "verdictNote": "B2C, different market. But the pattern validates your thesis: high-stakes + opaque pricing + AI governance = demand. LUMEN SDK is the enterprise version of this for clinical AI."

      "takeaway": "95% of AI-adopting organizations now have governance processes, but 99% face scaling barriers. Key priorities: review protocols for AI-generated content, quality audits, policies against shadow AI (unapproved tools staff use), and patient consent for AI processing. URAC offers accreditation for ethical, transparent AI use. The gap between having governance and enforcing it at runtime is exactly where LUMEN SDK lives.",
      "linkedinAngle": "95% of healthcare orgs have AI governance. 99% can't scale it. The missing piece isn't policy — it's enforcement at the moment of decision. That's the gap FORGE Health fills with runtime decision assurance."

      "takeaway": "AI agents are moving from passive assistants to proactive actors: handling prior authorizations, care gap identification, predictive deterioration alerts, triage, risk assessment, and flagging contraindications. BCG predicts agents will handle multi-step clinical workflows autonomously. The risk: agents making decisions without defensible governance trails. LUMEN SDK provides the decision assurance layer these agents need.",
      "linkedinAngle": "BCG says AI agents will handle prior auths, triage, and care gaps autonomously. Great for efficiency. Terrifying for liability. Every agent decision needs a defensible record. Who's building that layer?"

      "takeaway": "Federal deregulation under Trump administration removes barriers (no AI model card requirements), prioritizing innovation over oversight. Meanwhile, states are leading with patchwork AI laws, creating multi-state compliance nightmares for hospitals. Key insight: regulatory fragmentation makes internal governance frameworks essential — you can't rely on external enforcement.",
      "linkedinAngle": "Federal AI regulation is loosening. State laws are fragmenting. Hospitals are stuck in compliance purgatory. The winners will be those who build internal governance frameworks that work across jurisdictions. That's what LUMEN SDK enables."

The perseverance isn't glamorous — it's the 6am calls, the pitch decks at midnight, the constant iteration. Half the battle is just not stopping. You haven't stopped. The other half is making sure the vision stays sharp while the grind continues. Enjoy Paradise Island. When you're back, ViVE is 2.5 weeks out, HIMSS is 4.5 weeks out, and the market is screaming for what you've built."
