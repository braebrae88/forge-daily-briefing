    "appName": "MedSafety Alert Engine",
    "problem": "Healthcare workers miss critical safety alerts buried in EHR interfaces, leading to preventable adverse events. Current alert systems are noisy and don't prioritize effectively.",
    "solution": "Chrome extension that overlays intelligent safety alerts on any EHR interface using FDA MedWatch data + ISMP safety bulletins. Smart prioritization based on patient context (age, allergies, current meds).",
    "moat": "Real-time FDA MedWatch API integration + ISMP safety bulletin parsing. Most competitors focus on drug interactions, not safety alerts.",
    "dataSource": "FDA MedWatch RSS feeds, ISMP safety bulletins, Joint Commission sentinel event alerts, Health Canada advisories",
    "competitionCheck": "Chrome Web Store has basic drug checkers but no real-time safety alert overlays. Clear gap.",
    "buildTime": "2 nights (Chrome extension + FDA API integration)",
    "deployTo": "Chrome Web Store initially, then Edge, Firefox. Potential Teams app for hospital IT depts.",
    "monetization": "$9.99/month per user, freemium model with basic alerts free, advanced prioritization paid",
    "confidence": "High - real pain point, underserved data source, fast deployment path"
