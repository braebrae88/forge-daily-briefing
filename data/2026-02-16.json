    "problem": "Hospitals allocate only 4.2% of AI budgets to governance (Black Book Research). 78% lack audit-ready AI policies. CIOs know they need governance but have no tool to plan/benchmark spend.",
    "solution": "Self-service web app: input hospital size, AI project count, regulatory jurisdiction → get benchmark governance budget, policy gap checklist, audit-readiness score, and compliance timeline aligned to Joint Commission-CHAI 7 pillars.",
    "moat": "Proprietary benchmark data from public reports (Black Book, Guidehouse/HIMSS, CHAI). Continuously updated regulatory requirements. FORGE's deep healthcare governance expertise.",
    "dataSource": "Black Book Research reports, Guidehouse/HIMSS survey data, Joint Commission-CHAI framework, state AI law tracker (public legislative databases), CMS/HHS regulatory filings.",
    "competitionCheck": "No direct competitor. Big consultancies do this manually at $50K+. No self-service tool exists for hospital AI governance budgeting.",
    "buildTime": "2-3 nights",
    "deployTo": "Web app (forgelumen.ca subdomain), Azure Marketplace, potentially Teams app",
    "monetization": "Freemium: free basic assessment, $49/mo for full benchmark dashboard + quarterly updates, $199/mo for multi-facility + compliance tracking",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "The Guidehouse survey (Feb 13) and Black Book report both confirm hospitals are flying blind on governance budgets. This is a pain point CIOs are actively feeling pre-HIMSS (March 9-12). Perfect timing to launch before the conference."
