    "problem": "California AB 489, Texas TRAIGA, and Colorado AI Act all took effect Jan-Jun 2026. Every health app, patient portal, and AI chatbot now needs specific disclosure language or faces enforcement. No simple tool exists to audit compliance across states.",
    "solution": "Chrome extension + web dashboard that scans patient-facing AI interfaces (chatbots, portals, telehealth) for required disclosure language by jurisdiction. Flags missing disclosures, generates compliant copy, tracks state-by-state requirements as they evolve.",
    "moat": "Continuously updated regulatory database (state bills are public but fragmented). FORGE's healthcare regulatory expertise. First-mover in multi-state AI disclosure compliance tooling.",
    "dataSource": "State legislature APIs, public bill text (LegiScan), ONC HTI-1 requirements, CMS guidance docs — all free, public, but nobody is aggregating them into actionable checklists.",
    "competitionCheck": "Checked Chrome Web Store and app stores — zero dedicated tools for healthcare AI disclosure compliance. Big compliance firms (Akerman, BakerDonelson) write blogs but sell $500/hr advisory. No self-service SaaS.",
    "buildTime": "2-3 nights (Chrome extension + simple dashboard + regulatory JSON database)",
    "deployTo": "Chrome Web Store (primary), web app (dashboard), Azure Marketplace (enterprise tier)",
    "monetization": "Free tier: 5 scans/month, 1 state. Pro $49/mo: unlimited scans, all states, alerts on new laws. Enterprise $199/mo: API access, audit reports, custom jurisdictions.",

      "takeaway": "Sutter Health embedding AI-powered evidence search directly into Epic — natural language queries for peer-reviewed literature at point of care. This is exactly the CDS integration layer where LUMEN SDK sits: who validates the AI output before it reaches the clinician?",
      "linkedInAngle": "Sutter is doing it right — embedding AI evidence into clinical workflows. But here's the question nobody's asking: who validates the AI's recommendation before it reaches the clinician? That's the governance gap LUMEN was built to fill."

      "linkedInAngle": "Three states, three different AI disclosure requirements, all effective NOW. If your health AI touches patients in CA, TX, or CO — you need runtime governance, not just a policy document. This is where embeddable compliance SDKs become essential."

      "linkedInAngle": "96% of US hospitals now face mandatory AI transparency requirements under HTI-1. The question isn't whether to govern AI — it's HOW to do it at runtime, at scale, without breaking clinical workflows."

    "reflection": "Sean — three states just mandated AI disclosure in healthcare. HTI-1 is live. Sutter is embedding AI into Epic. The market is moving from 'should we govern AI?' to 'HOW do we govern AI at runtime?' That's not a trend — that's a runway being built under your feet. LUMEN isn't early anymore. It's on time."
