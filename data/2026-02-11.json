    "summary": "Real-time auditing layer for AI-generated clinical documentation. As ambient scribes (Nuance DAX, Augmedix, etc.) become standard in 2026, hospitals face a new problem: who validates what the AI wrote? This tool sits between ambient AI output and EMR commit, scoring documentation for clinical accuracy, completeness, coding compliance (ICD-10/CPT), and liability risk. Catches hallucinated medications, missed diagnoses, and documentation gaps before they hit the chart. B2B SaaS: $15/provider/month for clinics, $5K-25K/month enterprise. Distribution: EMR vendors (Epic/Cerner marketplace), ambient scribe vendors as add-on, direct to health systems. 85% of hospitals now use AI documentation — but zero have runtime validation.",

    "revenueEstimate": "$5M-$50M ARR",
    "healthcareAngle": "DIRECTLY aligned with LUMEN SDK thesis. This IS runtime decision assurance for clinical AI — just scoped to documentation. The scoring kernel approach (accuracy, compliance, liability) mirrors LUMEN's multi-criteria decision analysis. Could be: (1) a vertical application built ON the SDK, proving the platform; (2) a partnership play where LUMEN SDK powers the validation layer; (3) competitive intel if someone else builds it first. The market timing is perfect — ambient AI is going mainstream in 2026 but the 'trust layer' doesn't exist yet. This is the governance gap LUMEN addresses. Build it or partner with someone who does.",
    "verdict": "strong-signal",
    "verdictNote": "This validates the LUMEN SDK thesis from a different angle. Documentation validation is RUNTIME governance for clinical AI. Consider: could LUMEN SDK be positioned as the engine that powers products like this?"

      "url": "https://www.urac.org/blog/health-care-ai-in-2026-governance-and-trust-take-center-stage/",
      "takeaway": "URAC — the healthcare accreditation body — explicitly calls 2026 'the year of governance.' C-suites are catching up to clinicians who adopted GenAI in 2024-25. The challenge: implementation isn't the bottleneck anymore — governance is. Organizations without clear oversight frameworks are exposed. URAC hints at certification pathways for AI governance. This validates CHAI alignment AND potential accreditation play for LUMEN SDK compliance packs.",
      "linkedinAngle": "URAC just declared 2026 the year of AI governance — not innovation. The accreditation body that certifies health plans says organizations without clear AI oversight are now exposed. Certification pathways are forming. If your AI infrastructure isn't auditable, you're building on sand."

      "url": "https://www.ferrumhealth.com/resources/clinical-ai-in-2026-navigating-law-ethics-and-accountability",
      "takeaway": "Deep dive on the fragmented regulatory landscape — state laws, federal guidance, FDA-cleared vs non-FDA tools. Key insight: the distinction between 'cleared' and 'safe' is blurring as LDT-style AI proliferates. Organizations need governance that connects innovation to compliance AND trust. The accountability question isn't theoretical anymore — it's operational.",
      "linkedinAngle": "The FDA cleared it. But is it safe? In 2026, clinical AI lives in a regulatory gray zone: state laws, federal guidance, LDT exemptions. The organizations winning aren't the ones with the most AI — they're the ones with governance frameworks that make 'cleared' and 'safe' mean the same thing."

BUT governance lags adoption — most hospitals still lack formal AI committees. Large hospitals (90%+ adoption) vs small (<60%) disparity is growing. The federal government is now tracking governance as a metric. This is regulatory signal: governance will be mandated.",
      "linkedinAngle": "Federal data just dropped: 71% of hospitals now use predictive AI. Billing automation jumped 25 points in one year. But here's the buried lede: most hospitals STILL lack formal AI governance committees. ONC is tracking this now. Translation: governance requirements are coming. Get ahead or get regulated."
