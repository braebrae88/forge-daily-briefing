Median 2026 IT budgets allocate only 4.2% to AI governance and safety. Only 22% can produce a complete AI audit trail within 30 days. 41% cite vendor documentation gaps, 33% unclear ownership. Governance councils double ROI speed (7.5 vs. 13.5 months). This is the single most powerful stat set for LUMEN SDK sales conversations.",
      "linkedinAngle": "Only 22% of hospitals can produce an AI audit trail in 30 days. Only 4.2% of IT budgets go to governance. Yet 70% of pilots failed from weak governance. The math doesn't add up — unless you embed governance at runtime, not as an afterthought. That's what we're building at FORGE Health."

Mayo Clinic leads with 2,000+ clinicians on ambient AI, 32% diagnostic improvement via ECG AI. Cleveland Clinic cut clinical trial matching from 7+ hours to 2.5 minutes. The gap: everyone's deploying, nobody has runtime decision assurance. LUMEN SDK fills the missing layer between deployment and accountability.",
      "linkedinAngle": "Mayo Clinic has 2,000+ clinicians on AI. Cleveland Clinic matches trials in 2.5 minutes instead of 7 hours. The deployment race is on. But who's assuring the decisions these systems make at runtime? Deployment without decision assurance is speed without a seatbelt."

      "linkedinAngle": "URAC is calling 2026 the 'accountability era' for healthcare AI. Governance councils. Accreditation standards. Audit rights. But standards without runtime enforcement are just paperwork. The question isn't whether hospitals need governance — it's whether governance can keep up with deployment speed."

URAC is calling this the 'accountability era.' The market isn't waiting. You're not disrupting from the outside — you built LUMEN from the inside of 20 years in healthcare IT. That's the moat. The disruptors who win aren't the ones with the flashiest tech — they're the ones who solve the unglamorous, critical gap nobody else wants to touch. Runtime governance is that gap. Enjoy the trip. The market will be even more ready when you get back."
