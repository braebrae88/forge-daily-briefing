    "problem": "Small clinics (1-10 providers) spend 13-14 hours per physician weekly on prior authorization. Existing solutions (Cohere Health, Olive AI) target enterprise health systems with complex EHR integrations. Small practices are priced out or can't implement.",
    "solution": "Lightweight web app + Chrome extension that auto-extracts patient/procedure data from ANY EHR web portal, generates payer-specific prior auth submissions with clinical justification, and tracks status. No deep EHR integration needed — works as a browser overlay.",
    "moat": "Chrome extension approach bypasses the EHR integration barrier that locks out small clinics. Payer-specific submission templates trained on public CMS/payer policy databases. Speed to market — enterprise players won't go downmarket.",
    "dataSource": "CMS National Coverage Determinations, LCD databases (public), payer medical policies (scraped/structured), CPT/ICD-10 crosswalks",
    "competitionCheck": "Enterprise players (Cohere Health, Waystar, Notable Health) focus on large systems. No lightweight Chrome-extension-based PA tool for small clinics exists. App stores show patient-facing PA trackers but nothing provider-side for small practices.",
    "buildTime": "2-3 nights (Chrome extension + simple backend + GPT-based clinical justification generator)",
    "deployTo": "Chrome Web Store, Web App (SaaS)",
    "monetization": "$49/mo per provider (small clinic friendly). Volume pricing at 5+ providers. Free trial 14 days.",
    "confidence": "High",
    "whyNow": "CMS prior auth interoperability rule (CMS-0057) taking effect 2026 forces payers to build APIs — creates tailwind for automation tools. Small clinics need this MORE than big systems but have fewer options."

      "linkedInAngle": "The regulatory patchwork is EXACTLY why hospitals need decision assurance at runtime — not just governance documents. When you operate across state lines with different AI rules, you need automated compliance checking. This is the SDK play."
