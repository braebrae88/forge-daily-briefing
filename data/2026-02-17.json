    "problem": "78% of health systems run AI projects but only 52% feel operationally ready (Guidehouse/HIMSS Feb 2026). The #1 gap: governance. CIOs have no easy way to track which state/provincial AI laws apply to their deployed models. California AB 489 just kicked in Jan 2026, more coming. Compliance teams are drowning in spreadsheets.",
    "solution": "A lightweight SaaS dashboard that maps your AI inventory against active healthcare AI regulations by jurisdiction. Input your AI tools + locations → get a live compliance status board with alerts when new laws or guidance drop. Think 'Have I Been Pwned' but for healthcare AI compliance.",
    "moat": "LUMEN Scanner's 25+ jurisdiction database + 12 framework monitors = nobody else has this data pipeline built. First-mover on continuous monitoring vs. one-time assessments.",
    "dataSource": "State legislature feeds, FDA guidance RSS, NIST updates, Health Canada directives, provincial privacy commissioners — all public, all underutilized in real-time tooling.",
    "competitionCheck": "No direct competitor doing real-time healthcare AI regulatory tracking as SaaS. OneTrust/Vanta do general privacy — not healthcare AI specific. URAC offers accreditation (consulting), not tooling.",
    "buildTime": "2-3 nights — leverage existing LUMEN Scanner codebase, add web UI + alerts",
    "deployTo": "Web app (self-service signup), Azure Marketplace, Chrome extension for quick checks",
    "monetization": "Free: 3 AI tools tracked, 1 jurisdiction. Pro $49/mo: unlimited tools, all jurisdictions, alerts. Enterprise $199/mo: API access, audit reports, team seats.",
    "confidence": "High — validated by Guidehouse data showing governance is THE gap, and FORGE already has the scanner infrastructure"
