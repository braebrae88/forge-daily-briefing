    "problem": "Hospital CIOs and compliance officers can't keep up with the avalanche of state AI bills affecting healthcare — 15+ states introduced new bills in the past week alone. No tool aggregates and distills these into actionable alerts by jurisdiction.",
    "solution": "Real-time legislative intelligence feed that monitors state and federal AI bills impacting healthcare, scores relevance by jurisdiction, and delivers weekly digest emails + Slack/Teams notifications. Dashboard shows which bills affect YOUR state, with plain-English summaries and compliance action items.",
    "moat": "Curated healthcare-specific legislative data (not generic AI law trackers). FORGE's domain expertise scores relevance. First-mover in healthcare-specific AI legislative monitoring as a self-service SaaS.",
    "dataSource": "LegiScan API (free tier available), state legislature RSS feeds, Federal Register, CMS/HHS announcements. Transparency Coalition AI tracker as validation source.",
    "competitionCheck": "Generic AI law trackers exist (TCAI map, BSA tracker) but none are healthcare-specific, none offer compliance action items, none deliver as SaaS with alerts. No app store competitors found.",
    "buildTime": "2-3 nights — scraper + scoring engine + email digest + simple dashboard",
    "deployTo": "Web app (SaaS), Chrome extension for compliance officers, Slack/Teams integration",
    "monetization": "Free: 1 state, weekly digest. Pro $49/mo: all states + federal, daily alerts, Teams/Slack integration, compliance action items. Enterprise $199/mo: API access, custom jurisdiction bundles, audit trail.",
    "confidence": "High — the Feb 13 TCAI legislative update alone shows 15+ active healthcare AI bills. This pain is real and growing weekly. Aligns perfectly with LUMEN Scanner positioning."
