    "reflection": "Sean, every day LUMEN isn't in the market is a day competitors could catch up. The regulatory intelligence scanner runs daily, the SDK architecture is patent-worthy, and healthcare needs runtime governance now. ShiftGuard AI above shows there are quick wins everywhere - but LUMEN is the big play. Focus on the patent filing for the three-tier governance model this week. Disney built an empire by doing, not planning."
