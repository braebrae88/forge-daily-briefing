That's exactly what Lumen SDK does for clinical AI. Validates the thesis that runtime governance layers are needed wherever high-stakes decisions meet regulatory pressure.",

Key points: (1) As ambient AI floods systems, automated Clinical Decision Support raises questions about over-controlling physicians — this is the exact tension Lumen SDK resolves. (2) AI may soon be like ultrasound — malpractice NOT to use it, making defensibility mandatory. (3) AI-draft patient messages only used 20% of time — clinicians need trust, not just output.",
