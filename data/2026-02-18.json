    "name": "AI Governance Readiness Scorecard (Teams App)",
    "problem": "48% of hospitals aren't operationally ready for AI at scale (Guidehouse-HIMSS Feb 2026). CIOs need a fast self-assessment tool — not a 6-month consulting engagement — to identify governance gaps before Joint Commission/CHAI audits start.",
    "solution": "A lightweight Microsoft Teams app that walks hospital leaders through the 7 CHAI governance pillars with scored questions, generates a readiness scorecard PDF, benchmarks against anonymized peer data, and flags priority gaps with remediation steps.",
    "moat": "FORGE's deep CHAI/NIST AI RMF expertise baked into scoring logic. Benchmarking data grows with usage (network effect). First-mover in Teams App Store for healthcare AI governance.",
    "dataSource": "Joint Commission-CHAI framework (public), NIST AI RMF (public), state AI law tracker (public regulatory feeds), anonymized aggregate scores from users.",
    "competitionCheck": "No healthcare AI governance self-assessment in Teams App Store. Compliance tools exist (Vanta, Drata) but none healthcare-AI-specific. Consulting firms charge $50K+ for what this does in 20 minutes.",
    "buildTime": "2-3 nights — questionnaire logic + PDF generation + Teams manifest",
    "deployTo": "Microsoft Teams App Store (primary), Azure Marketplace, web standalone",
    "monetization": "Free tier: 1 assessment/quarter. Pro: $49/org/month (unlimited assessments, benchmarking, remediation playbooks). Enterprise: custom.",
    "confidence": "High",
    "whyNow": "Joint Commission-CHAI voluntary certification coming later 2026. Hospitals will scramble to self-assess before audits begin. First-mover window is NOW."
